I've moved the site to Hugo since I wanted to switch from GitHub pages to hosting it
on [https://blog.mikail-khan.com](https://blog.mikail-khan.com). Manually translating each
post really put into perspective how much writing I've done. Apparently there was a hugo
import command the whole time.

I had a post from May 13, 2020 about moving to Jekyll. I guess 584 days is the time to beat for Hugo.
